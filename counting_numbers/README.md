## :clipboard: Description

<p> This is my answer to the exercise: (Analyzing the Collatz conjecture)[http://dojopuzzles.com/problems/analisando-a-conjectura-de-collatz/]</p>

> The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
> n → n/2 (n is even)
> n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
>
> Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
>
> 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
> It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

<p>But, I chose to ask the user for the limit number instead of using 1,000,000</p>
