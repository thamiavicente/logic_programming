## :clipboard: Description

<p> Here is my code for the exercise: </p>

[Prime Words](http://dojopuzzles.com/problems/palavras-primas/#)

> A prime number is defined by having exactly two divisors: the number one and itself. Examples of prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 101, 367 and 523.

> In this problem, you must read a word composed only of letters [a-zA-Z]. Each letter has a specific value, a is worth 1, b is worth 2 and so on, until the letter z is worth 26. In the same way, A is worth 27, B is worth 28, up to the letter Z is worth 52.

>You need to define whether each word in a word set is prime or not. For it to be prime, the sum of its letter values must be a prime number.
